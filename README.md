## Differences

This server does not require installing a new UE plugin as it uses the built-in Python remote execution protocol.

Adding new tools/features is much faster to develop since it does not require any C++ code.

It can support the full [Unreal Engine Python API](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/python-api)


## Note

- This is not an official Unreal Engine project.
- Your AI agents or tools will have full access to your Editor.
- Review any changes your Client suggests before you approve them.

## Installation

#### Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.4+ (verified, may work with earlier versions)
- Node.js with npx
- MCP Client (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

1. Setting up your Editor:
   - Open your Unreal Engine project
   - Go to `Edit` -> `Plugins`
   - Search for "Python Editor Script Plugin" and enable it
   - Restart the editor if prompted
   - Go to `Edit` -> `Project Settings` 
   - Search for "Python" and enable the "Enable Remote Execution" option

  ![enable remote execution](https://github.com/runreal/unreal-mcp/raw/refs/heads/main/img2.png)

2. Set up your Client:
   - Edit your Claude (or Cursor) config
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unreal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@runreal/unreal-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error similar to `MCP Unreal: Unexpected token 'C', Connection...` it means that the mcp-server was not able to connect to the Unreal Editor.

- Make sure that the Python Editor Script Plugin is enabled and that the Remote Execution option is checked in your project settings.
- Try also changing your bind address from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` but note that this will allow connections from your local network.
- Restart your Unreal Editor fully.
- Fully close/open your client (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to ensure it reconnects to the MCP server. (`File -> Exit` on windows).
- Check your running processes and kill any zombie unreal-mcp Node.js processes.
